// user deposit fixed amount and the contract picks the winner after every 7 days (for now i thought only one winner and try to pick three winners if the number of entries are higher,and the winner gets the token ad they can transfer to respective protocals decided by the contract  if they want to use them there.)
we have to use the vrf for picking the random winner,automation function for picking the winner after every 7 days and ccip to transfer tokens to multiple chains.
